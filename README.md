Show air quality data for multiple air quality stations in Macedonia

## Description

The Air Quality data is provided by the Ministry of environment and physical planning of R. Macedonia and will only work for the country.

The data is measured by physical stations across the country and is provided via RESTful service. More information can be found on the AIR Quality portal:

* [Governemnt Air Quality Portal](http://air.moepp.gov.mk/?page_id=1351&lang=en)

The data is cached for 30 minutes by the plugin and it's refreshed hourly.

Friendly Note: The plugin is country specific and will not work with any other countries.
